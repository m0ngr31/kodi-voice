# By default, if you ask to play media without specifying the type, the skill
# will search through the entire library to find a match.
#
# For example, if you ask, "Alexa, ask Kodi to play ninety nine red balloons,"
# the skill will search library items in the following order to find the song:
#
#   Movies -> Shows -> Artists -> Songs -> Albums
#
# If your library is really large, this can take some time to complete.  While
# it will eventually execute, Alexa may report that the skill timed out.  If
# this behavior bothers you, you can disable deep searches.
#
# When disabled, Alexa will simply provide help in the response directing you
# to issue a play command that includes the media type of the item.

# Search results for new Movie and Episodes

# By default we ask kodi to return a max of 90 results per JSON request. 
# Here you can set this figure to optimize the system for you.

# Lower figures will produce faster results, but will reduce how far back it searches
